Name: Cycle Game
Game: Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.
Rules:  Players can move up, down, left and right...
            Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
            Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
        Each player's trail grows as they move.
        Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
        If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
            A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
            The cycles turn white.
            Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
